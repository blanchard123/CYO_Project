# CYO_Project

Brief Description: Repository for the Choose Your Own (CYO) Project for HarvardX PH125.9x Data Science Capstone, the final course of the HarvardX Professional Certificate in Data Science.

Long Description: The Choose Your own (CYO) Project is part of the requirements for the Capstone Course in the HarvardX Professional Certificate in Data Science. This project is the second of two final capstone projects for the certificate program. The goal of the capstone projects is to demonstrate the skills gained throughout the previous courses in this program. This project aimed to use various behavioural, biological, and physiological characteristics of patients experiencing heart failure to predict patient mortality. The publicly available dataset consisted of records from 299 patients with heart failure who attended the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology or the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad, Pakistan in 2015. Specifically, the project describes the dataset and variables, notes the data wrangling processes, examines the dataset using visualization, summary statistics, and inferential analyses, and then describes the development and performance of several machine learning models aimed at predicting patient death.
